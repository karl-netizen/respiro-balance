# Supabase Security Configuration Guide

**Purpose**: Configure password leak detection and security settings in Supabase Dashboard
**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes
**Security Issue**: #1 - Password Leak Detection

---

## Overview

This guide walks you through enabling password leak detection in your Supabase project to prevent users from setting compromised passwords.

**What This Prevents**:
- Users setting passwords from data breaches (e.g., "password123")
- Credential stuffing attacks
- Account takeovers

---

## Local Development Configuration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

The `supabase/config.toml` file has been updated with:

```toml
[auth]
enabled = true
# ... existing settings ...

# Password Security (Security Issue #1 - Password Leak Detection)
enable_password_leak_detection = true
password_min_length = 8
password_required_characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Local development is now protected

---

## Production Dashboard Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Log in to your account
3. Select your project: **tlwlxlthrcgscwgmsamo**

### Step 2: Navigate to Authentication Settings

1. Click **Authentication** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Providers** tab
3. Click **Email** provider

### Step 3: Enable Password Leak Detection

Scroll down to **"Password Protection"** section and configure:

#### 3.1 Enable Leak Detection
```
‚òëÔ∏è Enable password leak detection

Description shown: "Prevent users from using passwords that have
appeared in known data breaches. Uses the HaveIBeenPwned API."
```

**What This Does**:
- Checks passwords against 600+ million known leaked passwords
- Blocks signup/password change if password is compromised
- Uses k-Anonymity model (your password is never sent to third party)
- Free service, no API key needed

#### 3.2 Minimum Password Length
```
Minimum Length: 8 characters

Recommended: 8-16 characters
Current: 8 ‚úÖ
```

#### 3.3 Password Requirements
Enable these checkboxes:

```
‚òëÔ∏è Require lowercase letters (a-z)
‚òëÔ∏è Require uppercase letters (A-Z)
‚òëÔ∏è Require numbers (0-9)
‚òê Require special characters (!@#$%^&*)
```

**Why not special characters?**
- 8+ chars with upper/lower/numbers = 218 trillion combinations
- Special characters often cause UX friction
- Mobile keyboards make special chars harder
- Our config already provides strong security

### Step 4: Save Configuration

1. Scroll to bottom of page
2. Click **"Save"** button
3. Wait for success confirmation
4. Refresh page to verify settings persisted

## Testing Password Leak Detection

### Test 1: Weak Password (Should FAIL)

Try signing up with a known leaked password:

**Test Credentials**:
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

**Expected Result**:
```
‚ùå Error: "This password has appeared in a data breach and cannot be used.
Please choose a different password."
```

### Test 2: Strong Password (Should SUCCEED)

Try signing up with a strong password:

**Test Credentials**:
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `MyS3cur3P@ssw0rd!`

**Expected Result**:
```
‚úÖ Success: Account created successfully
```

### Test 3: Too Short Password (Should FAIL)

**Test Credentials**:
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `Abc123`

**Expected Result**:
```
‚ùå Error: "Password must be at least 8 characters long"
```

### Test 4: Missing Requirements (Should FAIL)

**Test Credentials**:
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `alllowercase123`

**Expected Result**:
```
‚ùå Error: "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter"
```

---

## Verification Checklist

After configuring the dashboard, verify:

- [ ] **Leaked passwords blocked**: Test signup with "password123" - should fail
- [ ] **Short passwords blocked**: Test with "Abc12" (5 chars) - should fail
- [ ] **Missing uppercase blocked**: Test with "abcd1234" - should fail
- [ ] **Missing lowercase blocked**: Test with "ABCD1234" - should fail
- [ ] **Missing numbers blocked**: Test with "Abcdefgh" - should fail
- [ ] **Strong passwords accepted**: Test with "MyP@ssw0rd2025" - should succeed

## How Password Leak Detection Works

### The HaveIBeenPwned API

1. **User enters password**: "MyPassword123"
2. **Supabase hashes it**: SHA-1 hash
3. **Sends first 5 characters** of hash to API (e.g., "21BD1")
4. **API returns** all hash suffixes starting with "21BD1"
5. **Supabase checks** if full hash exists in results
6. **Blocks or allows** based on match

**Privacy**: Your actual password is NEVER sent to the API.

### Example Flow

```
User Password: "password123"
‚Üì
SHA-1 Hash: "cbfdac6008f9cab4083784cbd1874f76618d2a97"
‚Üì
First 5 chars sent: "cbfda"
‚Üì
API returns: List of all hashes starting with "cbfda"
‚Üì
Supabase finds: "c6008f9cab4083784cbd1874f76618d2a97" in list
‚Üì
Result: ‚ùå "This password has appeared in a data breach"
```

## Password Strength Examples

### ‚ùå Rejected Passwords

| Password | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| `password123` | Leaked in data breaches |
| `qwerty` | Common password, leaked |
| `abc123` | Too short (6 chars) |
| `alllowercase` | Missing uppercase + numbers |
| `ALLUPPERCASE` | Missing lowercase + numbers |
| `Password` | Missing numbers |

### ‚úÖ Accepted Passwords

| Password | Strength |
|----------|----------|
| `MyP@ssw0rd2025` | Excellent (special chars + all requirements) |
| `BlueSky123` | Good (8+ chars, upper/lower/number) |
| `TreeHouse456` | Good (10 chars, meets all requirements) |
| `Coffee2Morning` | Good (readable, secure) |

**Best Practice**: Use passphrases (3-4 random words + numbers)
- Example: `Coffee2Morning9Blue` = 18 chars, very secure

---

## Production Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify):

```bash
# Required in production
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://tlwlxlthrcgscwgmsamo.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
VITE_APP_ENV=production
VITE_DEMO_MODE=false
```

**Note**: Password security is enforced by Supabase backend, not frontend env vars.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Password leak detection not working"

**Symptoms**: Weak passwords like "password123" are accepted

**Solutions**:
1. Verify dashboard settings are saved
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Check Supabase logs in Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
4. Ensure you're testing on correct project
5. Verify `enable_password_leak_detection = true` in config.toml

### Issue: "All passwords rejected"

**Symptoms**: Even strong passwords fail

**Solutions**:
1. Check HaveIBeenPwned API status: https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3
2. Check Supabase status: https://status.supabase.com/
3. Review error message for specific requirement missing
4. Temporarily disable and re-enable in dashboard

### Issue: "Settings not persisting"

**Symptoms**: Settings reset after saving

**Solutions**:
1. Check for browser console errors
2. Verify you have admin permissions on project
3. Try different browser
4. Contact Supabase support if persists

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Review authentication logs for blocked passwords
- [ ] Monitor signup success/failure rates
- [ ] Check for unusual password reset patterns

### Monthly Reviews
- [ ] Review password policy effectiveness
- [ ] Check HaveIBeenPwned API updates
- [ ] Verify Supabase security announcements

### Incident Response
If a user reports account takeover:
1. Force password reset for affected user
2. Review authentication logs
3. Check if password was leaked recently
4. Consider implementing 2FA (see SECURITY_AUDIT.md #5)

---

## Additional Security Recommendations

### Implement These Next (Priority Order)

1. **Email Verification** (Already enabled?)
   - Authentication ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Email
   - Enable "Confirm Email"

2. **Rate Limiting** (Check current settings)
   - Authentication ‚Üí Rate Limits
   - Recommended: 5 attempts per 15 minutes

3. **Session Management**
   - Already configured: `jwt_expiry = 3600` (1 hour)
   - Consider reducing to 1800 (30 min) for higher security

4. **2FA/MFA** (Future enhancement)
   - Authentication ‚Üí Providers
   - Enable "Phone" or "TOTP" providers
