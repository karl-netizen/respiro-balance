- **Progress Over Time**: Most valuable for long-term motivation and pattern recognition

**Avoiding Data Obsession:**
- Don't let metrics define your practice quality
- Subjective experience matters more than numbers
- Use data to support, not replace, inner awareness
- Take periodic "data-free" sessions

**Troubleshooting:**
- Inconsistent readings? Check device position
- No connection? Restart both devices
