## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Privacy Settings UI
1. Navigate to Settings → Privacy
2. Verify all 4 privacy controls are visible
3. Change each setting
4. Click "Save Privacy Settings"
5. Reload page
6. Verify settings persisted

**Expected**: Settings save and load correctly

### Test 2: Profile Privacy (Public)
1. User A sets `profile_visibility = "public"`
2. User B (not friend) views User A's profile
3. Verify User B can see display name and avatar

**Expected**: ✅ Profile visible

### Test 3: Profile Privacy (Friends Only)
1. User A sets `profile_visibility = "friends"`
2. User B (not friend) views User A's profile
3. Verify User B cannot see profile details
4. User A and B become friends
5. User B views User A's profile again
6. Verify User B can now see profile

**Expected**: ✅ Privacy respected, friends can view

### Test 4: Profile Privacy (Private)
1. User A sets `profile_visibility = "private"`
2. User B (friend) views User A's profile
3. Verify User B cannot see profile details

**Expected**: ✅ Only User A can view

### Test 5: Challenge Participation Privacy
1. User A sets `activity_visibility = "private"`
2. User A joins a challenge
3. User B views challenge participants
4. Verify User A does not appear in the list

**Expected**: ✅ User A hidden from challenge participants

### Test 6: Leaderboard Privacy
1. User A sets `leaderboard_participation = false`
2. User A completes challenge with high score
3. View challenge leaderboard
4. Verify User A does not appear

**Expected**: ✅ User A not on leaderboard

### Test 7: Stats Privacy (Friends Only)
1. User A sets `stats_visibility = "friends"`
2. User B (friend) views User A's stats
3. Verify stats are visible
4. User C (not friend) views User A's stats
5. Verify stats are hidden

**Expected**: ✅ Only friends see stats

## SQL Testing Queries

### Test Privacy Functions

```sql
-- Test can_view_profile function
SELECT can_view_profile(
  'target-user-id'::uuid,
  'requesting-user-id'::uuid
);
-- Expected: true if allowed, false if blocked

-- Test can_view_activity function
SELECT can_view_activity(
  'target-user-id'::uuid,
  'requesting-user-id'::uuid
);
-- Expected: true if allowed, false if blocked

-- Test is_friend_of function
SELECT is_friend_of(
  'user-a-id'::uuid,
  'user-b-id'::uuid
);
-- Expected: true if friends, false otherwise
```

### Test Privacy-Aware Views

```sql
-- Test public_meditation_stats view
SELECT * FROM public_meditation_stats
WHERE user_id = 'target-user-id';
-- Expected: Stats shown/hidden based on privacy settings

-- Test challenge_leaderboard view
SELECT * FROM challenge_leaderboard
WHERE challenge_id = 'some-challenge-id';
-- Expected: Only users with leaderboard_participation=true appear
```

### Test RLS Policies

```sql
-- As User A (not friend)
SET request.jwt.claims.sub = 'user-a-uuid';

-- Try to view User B's (private) challenge participation
SELECT * FROM challenge_participants_new
WHERE user_id = 'user-b-uuid';
-- Expected: 0 rows (blocked by RLS)

-- As User B (owner)
SET request.jwt.claims.sub = 'user-b-uuid';

-- View own challenge participation
SELECT * FROM challenge_participants_new
WHERE user_id = 'user-b-uuid';
-- Expected: All rows visible
```

---

## Migration Verification

### Check Privacy Settings Applied

```sql
-- Verify all users have privacy settings
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_social_profiles
WHERE privacy_settings IS NULL OR privacy_settings = '{}'::jsonb;
-- Expected: 0 (all users have settings)

-- View privacy settings distribution
SELECT
  privacy_settings->>'profile_visibility' AS profile_vis,
  privacy_settings->>'activity_visibility' AS activity_vis,
  privacy_settings->>'stats_visibility' AS stats_vis,
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_social_profiles
GROUP BY profile_vis, activity_vis, stats_vis;
-- Expected: Distribution of settings
```

### Check RLS Policies Exist

```sql
-- List all privacy-related policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname
FROM pg_policies
WHERE policyname LIKE '%privacy%' OR policyname LIKE '%view%';
-- Expected: Multiple privacy policies listed
```

### Check Functions Created

```sql
-- Verify privacy functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname IN ('can_view_profile', 'can_view_activity', 'is_friend_of');
-- Expected: All 3 functions listed
```

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Profile Settings**: Already have `privacy_settings` column, migration updates defaults
2. **Friendship Table**: Uses `friendships` table (not `user_friendships`)
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing users get "friends" visibility by default (safer than "public")

### Future Enhancements
1. **Granular Controls**: Per-activity type privacy (e.g., hide specific meditation sessions)
2. **Temporary Privacy**: Time-limited privacy changes
3. **Group Privacy**: Different settings for different friend groups
4. **Activity Logs**: More detailed audit trail of who viewed what

---

## Rollback Procedure

If privacy controls cause issues:

```sql
-- Revert to public visibility for all users (emergency only)
UPDATE user_social_profiles
SET privacy_settings = '{
  "profile_visibility": "public",
  "activity_visibility": "public",
  "stats_visibility": "public",
  "leaderboard_participation": true
}'::jsonb;

-- Drop new RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view challenge participants with privacy" ON challenge_participants_new;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view posts with privacy" ON social_posts;

-- Restore old policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view challenge participants"
  ON challenge_participants_new FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- Drop privacy functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS can_view_profile;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS can_view_activity;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS is_friend_of;
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Implementation Complete When**:
- [x] Migration runs without errors
- [x] All users have privacy settings
- [x] Privacy functions work correctly
- [x] RLS policies enforce privacy
- [x] UI component saves/loads settings
- [x] Testing scenarios pass

✅ **Production Ready When**:
- [ ] Tested with real user accounts
- [ ] Verified friend-based visibility works
- [ ] Confirmed leaderboard hiding works
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] User feedback positive

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Created
- `idx_user_social_profiles_privacy` (GIN index on privacy_settings)
- Existing indexes on friendships table

### Query Optimization
- Privacy functions use `SECURITY DEFINER STABLE` for caching
- Views pre-filter data at database level
- RLS policies use indexed columns

### Expected Impact
- **Query Time**: +10-50ms for privacy checks (acceptable)
- **Database Load**: Minimal (functions are cached)
- **User Experience**: No noticeable difference

---

## GDPR Compliance

### Privacy Rights Supported
✅ **Right to Privacy**: Users control visibility
✅ **Right to Access**: Users always see their own data
✅ **Right to Erasure**: Covered by existing user deletion flows
✅ **Right to Portability**: Unaffected by privacy controls

### Data Protection
✅ **Principle of Data Minimization**: Only show what's necessary
✅ **Purpose Limitation**: Privacy settings clearly explained
✅ **Transparency**: Users informed of what each setting does

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Privacy settings not saving
**Solution**: Check browser console for API errors, verify authentication

**Issue**: Friends can't see my profile
**Solution**: Verify friendship status is "accepted", check privacy_visibility setting

**Issue**: Still appearing on leaderboards with participation disabled
**Solution**: Clear cache, verify `leaderboard_participation = false` in database

### Debug Queries

```sql
-- Check user's privacy settings
SELECT privacy_settings FROM user_social_profiles
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';

-- Check friendship status
SELECT * FROM friendships
WHERE (user_id = 'user-a' AND friend_id = 'user-b')
   OR (user_id = 'user-b' AND friend_id = 'user-a');

-- Test privacy function directly
SELECT can_view_activity('target-user-id'::uuid, 'your-user-id'::uuid);
```
