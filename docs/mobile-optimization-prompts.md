# ðŸš€ Respiro Balance - Critical Mobile Optimization Prompts

## ðŸ”´ PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL MOBILE FIXES (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Dashboard Mobile Layout Fix
```
Fix the main dashboard component for mobile responsiveness. The current dashboard has layout issues on mobile devices - cards are too wide, spacing is cramped, and the mood tracker is not touch-friendly. Update the dashboard to use a single-column layout on mobile with proper spacing, larger touch targets (minimum 44px), and ensure all interactive elements are easily tappable. Add proper loading states and ensure smooth scrolling.
```

### 2. Chart Visualization Mobile Fix
```
Fix all chart and progress visualization components for mobile devices. Currently, charts are not responsive and cause horizontal scrolling on mobile. Update all chart components (Recharts, progress bars, analytics) to be mobile-first responsive, with touch-friendly interactions, proper scaling, and readable text sizes. Ensure charts adapt to small screens without losing functionality.
```

### 3. Modal and Dialog Mobile Fix
```
Fix all modal and dialog components for mobile responsiveness. Current modals are too large for mobile screens and don't scroll properly. Update all modals to be mobile-friendly with proper sizing, touch-friendly close buttons, scroll handling, and ensure they work well with mobile keyboards. Add swipe-to-dismiss functionality where appropriate.
```

### 4. Form Input Mobile Optimization
```
Optimize all form inputs for mobile devices. Fix input sizing, ensure proper keyboard types appear (email, number, tel), prevent zoom on focus for iOS, add proper touch targets, and ensure form validation messages are clearly visible on mobile. Update all authentication forms, settings forms, and user input forms.
```

### 5. Navigation Menu Mobile Fix
```
Fix the mobile navigation menu and header. Ensure the hamburger menu works smoothly, navigation items are touch-friendly, and the mobile menu doesn't interfere with page content. Add proper animations and ensure the menu is accessible with proper focus management.
```

## ðŸŸ¡ PRIORITY 2: PERFORMANCE & TOUCH OPTIMIZATION

### 6. Touch Interaction Enhancement
```
Add comprehensive touch interaction support across the app. Implement proper touch feedback with haptic responses where supported, add swipe gestures for navigation, ensure all buttons have proper touch states, and add pull-to-refresh functionality on relevant screens. Update all interactive elements to follow mobile touch guidelines.
```

### 7. Mobile Performance Optimization
```
Optimize the app performance specifically for mobile devices. Implement lazy loading for images and components, reduce bundle size for mobile, add proper loading states, optimize re-renders in dashboard and list components, and ensure smooth 60fps scrolling. Add performance monitoring for mobile devices.
```

### 8. Responsive Image Optimization
```
Optimize all images for mobile devices. Implement responsive images with proper srcset, add WebP support with fallbacks, ensure images load efficiently on slower mobile connections, and add proper alt texts for accessibility. Optimize meditation session images and UI graphics for mobile.
```

## ðŸŸ¢ PRIORITY 3: FEATURE-SPECIFIC MOBILE FIXES

### 9. Meditation Player Mobile Fix
```
Fix the meditation session player for mobile devices. Ensure audio controls are touch-friendly, progress bar is easily draggable on mobile, player works properly with device lock screen controls, and add background audio support. Fix any issues with mobile audio APIs and ensure seamless playback.
```

### 10. Focus Mode Timer Mobile Fix
```
Optimize the focus mode and Pomodoro timer for mobile. Ensure timer controls are touch-friendly, notifications work properly on mobile, timer continues running when app is backgrounded, and add mobile-specific features like vibration alerts and lock screen notifications.
```

### 11. Biofeedback Mobile Integration
```
Fix biofeedback components for mobile devices. Ensure device connection flows work on mobile, Bluetooth connectivity is properly handled, real-time data displays are readable on small screens, and touch interactions for device controls are optimized. Add mobile-specific device pairing flows.
```

### 12. Social Features Mobile Optimization
```
Optimize social and community features for mobile. Fix feed scrolling performance, ensure social interactions (like, comment, share) are touch-friendly, optimize image and content loading in feeds, and add proper mobile sharing functionality with native app integrations where possible.
```

## ðŸ”§ PRIORITY 4: ADVANCED MOBILE FEATURES

### 13. PWA Mobile Enhancements
```
Enhance the Progressive Web App features for mobile. Ensure proper offline functionality, add to home screen prompts work correctly, implement background sync for user data, add push notifications support, and ensure the app feels native on mobile devices. Fix any PWA installation issues.
```

### 14. Mobile Gesture Controls
```
Add advanced mobile gesture controls throughout the app. Implement swipe-to-go-back navigation, pinch-to-zoom for charts and images, swipe actions for list items (delete, favorite, etc.), and add gesture-based shortcuts for common actions. Ensure gestures don't conflict with native browser gestures.
```

### 15. Mobile Accessibility Optimization
```
Optimize the entire app for mobile accessibility. Ensure screen reader compatibility on mobile, proper focus management with virtual keyboards, touch target sizes meet accessibility guidelines (minimum 44px), high contrast mode support, and proper semantic markup for mobile assistive technologies.
